<h1>Making Someone Smile</h1>
<h2>FUNDRAISING FOR A BETTER EASTER</h2>
<h3>Fourteen families helped so far!</h3>

<p>
<div>Hi everyone, my name is Elina. I have watched and listened to so many inspiring people do so much for our society. It was always my goal to help and be useful.</div>

<div>I decided not to wait and start small.</div>

<div>So a year ago my partner and I went to the supermarket and with $300 we bought enough food to feed 3 families that needed help! How simple! We did it again and had nine people help us. Last Christmas we fed <b>eight </b>families.</div>

<div>This one pager is to ask if anyone wants to contribute. It is the most amazing thing - to give. I promise you will be smiling so much knowing that you made someone's Easter!</div>

<div>I do not have a charity registered but I can provide all the receipts necessary. And you can also join us on the around Easter weekend when we will buy groceries and drop them off to the families in Mt Roskill.</div>

<div>We have a contact in the community centre who directs us onto families with single mums, older people raising grandkids on their own and other people in need.</div>

<div>Please contact me if you have any questions or if you are ready to contribute! :) Anyone who donates will also receive a personalised card from yours truly. </div></p>
